# WebsocketEchoServer

This is an Electron app that creates a Websocket echo server. The goal of the server is simple; it echoes and rebroadcasts any message it receives. The primary goal of this server is to ferry messages between a website and Grasshopper -- for example, between a Teachable Machine model and Grasshopper.
