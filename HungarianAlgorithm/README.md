## HungarianAlgorithm

This implements the [Hungarian algorithm by Ivan Jurin](https://github.com/antifriz/hungarian-algorithm-n3) to solve the [Assignment problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assignment_problem)

This can be used to solve any sort of assignment problem between two sets of values. The component takes a 'costMatrix' represented as a dataTree.

This was created to represent data processed with T-SNE, ([using Owl, by Mateusz Zwierzycki](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/owl)) in 2d grid form. For an in-depth explanation of how this helps/works with T-SNE, [see here](https://blog.sourced.tech/post/lapjv/).
